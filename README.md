# 2020-05 - Binary Classification for Titanic dataset (Kaggle)
- This project started in May 2020. 
- The goal of this project is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. 
- The project is a competition on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 
- See [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/amitsarid/2020-05_Kaggle_Titanic/blob/master/main_notebook_titanic_feature_engineering_and_modeling_top5.ipynb) for my work on the project including feature engineering and modeling. My submission scored a 0.8134 which is in the top 4% (as of May 2020). 
- You can find a version of the notebook on Kaggle as well (https://www.kaggle.com/amitsar/titanic-top-5-feature-engineering-model).
